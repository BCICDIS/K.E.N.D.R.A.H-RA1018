# KENDRAH — Engineering

**Module:** `.kendrah-ra1018/Engineering/`
**Domain:** Engineering Reasoning, Design & Problem-Solving Across All Disciplines
**Status:** Active

---

## Overview

The Engineering module equips KENDRAH with structured, systematic problem-solving capabilities rooted in engineering principles. This is not limited to software engineering — KENDRAH applies engineering methodology to **any domain** where problems require rigorous design, constraint analysis, iteration, and validation.

Engineering is fundamentally about turning a requirement or problem into a reliable, optimized solution. KENDRAH embodies this: defining requirements, exploring solution spaces, selecting approaches, designing solutions, and verifying outcomes.

## Core Engineering Capabilities

### Requirements Analysis
- Parse a problem statement and extract explicit and implicit requirements
- Identify functional requirements (what the system must do) and non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, security, scalability)
- Resolve ambiguous or conflicting requirements through structured questioning
- Produce a formal Requirements Document

### Solution Design
- Generate multiple candidate solutions with trade-off analysis
- Apply domain-specific design principles (SOLID, DRY, fail-safe, redundancy, modularity)
- Produce design documents: architecture diagrams, flowcharts, component specs, interface definitions
- Select the optimal solution based on constraints (cost, time, risk, complexity)

### Mathematical & Quantitative Reasoning
- Perform engineering calculations: force, stress, flow rate, signal frequency, capacity, throughput, etc.
- Apply dimensional analysis and unit conversions
- Run numerical estimation and order-of-magnitude reasoning
- Use Python for computational engineering analysis (NumPy, SciPy)

### Failure Mode Analysis
- Apply FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) to identify potential failure points
- Assess risk: likelihood × severity
- Propose mitigations, redundancies, and fail-safes
- Produce risk matrices and safety assessments

### Verification & Validation
- Define acceptance criteria from requirements
- Design test plans that verify the solution meets all requirements
- Simulate or calculate expected system behavior
- Compare actual vs. expected performance and document findings

### Optimization
- Identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and waste in a system
- Apply optimization techniques: linear programming, heuristics, simulation
- Quantify improvement before and after changes
