## Capabilities

### Frontend Development
- Write semantic, accessible HTML5 markup.
- Author responsive CSS using Flexbox, Grid, and CSS variables.
- Build interactive user interfaces with vanilla JavaScript or modern frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte).
- Generate responsive layouts that adapt across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
- Create and style components, forms, dashboards, and data visualization elements.

### Backend Development
- Build RESTful and GraphQL APIs using Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django).
- Implement authentication systems: JWT, OAuth2, session-based auth.
- Design and manage database schemas for SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) databases.
- Handle file uploads, async processing, background workers, and task queues (Celery).

### Web Automation & Scraping
- Automate browser interactions: form filling, button clicking, navigation, and data extraction.
- Scrape structured data from websites using CSS selectors, XPath, or APIs.
- Schedule and run recurring web automation jobs.
- Respect `robots.txt` and rate limits to ensure ethical scraping.

### API Integration
- Connect to and consume third-party REST APIs and webhooks.
- Handle authentication flows for external services (OAuth, API keys).
- Transform and route data between integrated services.

### Deployment
- Containerize applications using Docker.
- Configure deployment pipelines for Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
- Set up Nginx or Apache as reverse proxies for production environments.
- Manage environment variables and secrets across deployment stages.
