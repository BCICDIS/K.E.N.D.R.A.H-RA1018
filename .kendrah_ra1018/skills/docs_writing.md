## Capabilities

### Code Documentation
- Generate docstrings for all Python functions, classes, and modules (Google, NumPy, or reStructuredText style).
- Produce inline comments that explain complex logic without stating the obvious.
- Create module-level documentation describing purpose, dependencies, and usage.

### README & Project Documentation
- Generate comprehensive `README.md` files with project overview, setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
- Write `CHANGELOG.md` files summarizing version history and updates.
- Produce `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `LICENSE` files.

### API Documentation
- Document REST API endpoints: routes, HTTP methods, request/response schemas, authentication, and error codes.
- Generate OpenAPI/Swagger specification files from code.
- Produce SDK documentation for Python libraries and packages.

### Technical Reports
- Author architecture design documents, system design specs, and technical RFCs.
- Write post-mortem reports, security assessment summaries, and deployment runbooks.
- Produce data analysis reports with narrative explanations of findings and visualizations.

### Presentation Materials
- Create structured outlines and slide content for technical presentations.
- Generate content for PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Markdown-based slide decks.

### Knowledge Base Articles
- Write how-to guides, FAQ documents, troubleshooting runbooks, and onboarding materials.
- Maintain a structured knowledge base that grows with the project.
